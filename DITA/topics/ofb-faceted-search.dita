    <title>Faceted Search</title>
  <body>
    <p><b>Oxygen Feedback</b> supports facets and faceted search. Facets are predefined
      categories that are associated with search results. By selecting one or more facets, users can
      narrow down their search results to a specific category or set of categories. This topic
      describes the process of collecting facets and what should you do in order to use this feature
      on your websites.</p>
    <section id="section_pmt_smc_bzb">
      <title>How are facets collected?</title>
      <p>In order to enable faceted search a documentation must have a
        <codeph>search-facets.json</codeph> that stores all the possible categories and their
        values. The file is located at this path:
        <codeph>$out-folder/oxygen-webhelp/app/facets/</codeph>  Here's what such file should look
        like:<codeblock id="codeblock_kpx_lrc_bzb" outputclass="language-json">{
  "facets": [
    {
      "key": "product",
      "navtitle": "Product",
      "categories": [
        {
          "key": "X2000",
          "navtitle": "X2000 Phone Guide",
          "categories": []
        },
        {
          "key": "X1000",
          "navtitle": "X1000 Phone Guide",
          "categories": []
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "key": "audience",
      "navtitle": "Audience",
      "categories": [
        {
          "key": "Technician",
          "navtitle": "Technician Levels",
          "categories": [
            {
              "key": "TechnicianOne",
              "navtitle": "Technician Level One",
              "categories": []
            },
            {
              "key": "TechnicianTwo",
              "navtitle": "Technician Level Two",
              "categories": []
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "key": "BasicUser",
          "navtitle": "Basic User Level",
          "categories": []
        }
      ]

  format="html" scope="external">topic</xref>.</p>
      <p>Besides this a topic must have a generated <codeph>meta</codeph> tag which stores the
        topic's category, subcategory and value. It should have the next
        structure:<codeblock id="codeblock_obh_gpc_bzb" outputclass="language-xml">&lt;meta name="topic-facet" content="family/lamiaceae"></codeblock></p>
      <p>In this example the topic will have the <codeph>family</codeph> category and
        <codeph>lamiaceae</codeph> value.</p>
      <p>Feedback search engine also supports hierarchical
        categories:<codeblock id="codeblock_zgd_jpc_bzb" outputclass="language-xml">&lt;meta name="topic-facet" content="level/advanced/technician"></codeblock></p>
      <p>In this example the topic will have the <codeph>level</codeph> category,
        <codeph>advanced</codeph> subcategory and <codeph>technician</codeph> value.</p>
