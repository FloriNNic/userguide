        <title>Cause</title>
        <p id="p_zhk_dgk_54b">Sometimes, macOS shows a popup about allowing the application access
          to some special folders (e.g. Downloads or Desktop), and unless you explicitly agree, it
          will leave it unchecked (the app does not allowed access). The popup can go unnoticed and
          disappears after a while, so it is easy to overlook it and the application will not have
          access to that folder.</p>

        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p id="p_a3k_dgk_54b">Go to the macOS <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>System preferences</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Security &amp; Privacey</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Privacy tab</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Files and Folders</uicontrol>
            </menucascade>. You should find <i>Oxygen</i> in that list and the folders you were
            prompted to access. Check the box for the folder (i.e. Downloads or Desktop), if there
            is one unchecked.<note id="note_efj_gth_w5b">If that does not work, look at "Full Disk
              Access" from the same Privacy tab. Add <i>Oxygen</i> there so that it has full access.
              However, only use this method as a last resort.</note></p>
