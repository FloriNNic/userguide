    <p id="p_w3v_bgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Merge Documents with Change Tracking Highlights</uicontrol>
      tool can be used to merge two XML documents, based on a 2-way mode comparison.</p>
    <p id="p_wlj_f1h_nyb">The files involved in the process are merged by saving the
        <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode comparison results as documents with highlighted tracked
      changes that can later be reviewed and accepted or rejected.</p>
    <p id="p_ylj_f1h_nyb">To invoke the tool, select the <uicontrol>Merge Documents with Change
        Tracking Highlights</uicontrol> action that is found in the <b>Tools</b> menu. It opens a
      dialog box where you can specify the documents to merge.</p>

    <p id="p_x5d_hgx_5pb">The <uicontrol>Merge Documents with Change Tracking Highlights</uicontrol>
      dialog box contains the following options:</p>
    <p id="p_p3d_5vj_vpb">
      <dl id="dl_q5g_5vj_vpb">
        <dlentry id="dlentry_r5g_5vj_vpb">
          <dt>Base document (URL)</dt>
          <dd>Specifies the URL of the base document.</dd>

        <dlentry id="dlentry_jv1_bwj_vpb">
          <dt>Directory to merge with (URL)</dt>
          <dd>Specifies the URL of the document to merge with.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p id="p_f1x_qhc_qyb">After specifying the documents to be merged, click the
        <uicontrol>Merge</uicontrol> button to trigger the operation.</p>
    <p id="p_mzx_czj_vpb">Once the merge operation is complete, the merged document is opened in a
      new editor tab. With the merged document open in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, the
      highlighted tracked changes can easily be reviewed and accepted or rejected, thus finishing
      the entire merge process. Initially, the merged document is untitled and not saved. You can
      choose the name when saving it in a location of your choosing (for example, a common use case
      is to overwrite the base document with the final resulting merged file).</p>
