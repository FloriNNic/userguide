    <title>Automatic subscription renewal</title>
    <body>
        <p>License server has a mechanism that tries to detect when you purchased a renewal of your
            current subscription and automatically update the license key.</p>
        <p>To know that a license key you purchased is a renewal of the license key you have
            currently installed in License Server, it uses the <uicontrol>Previous order reference
                number</uicontrol> if you filled it in the checkout process.  </p>
        <p>This automatic renewal mechanism makes an HTTP request to <xref
                href="https://oxygenxml.com/subscription_management/check_renewal.php" format="html"
                scope="external"
                >https://oxygenxml.com/subscription_management/check_renewal.php</xref> and passes
            as parameters:</p>
        <ul id="ul_l5r_hm5_t5b">
            <li>The SGN field of the existing license key</li>
            <li>The server signature that uniquely identifies the License Server installation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This request is made by the License Server automatically or manually by pressing the
                <uicontrol>Check now</uicontrol> link. </p>
        <p>This mechanism can be disabled by unchecking the <uicontrol>Automatically check for
                subscription renewal</uicontrol> checkbox.</p>
