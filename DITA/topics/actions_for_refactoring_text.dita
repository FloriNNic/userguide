    <title>Actions for Text Refactoring</title>
    <body>
        <p>Under the list of proposals, there is a toolbar that shows a set of buttons you can use
      to alter or refactor the selected text from the editor. For example, to transform a paragraph
      into a list with the summary of ideas, you can select its text, then click the
        <uicontrol>Ordered Lists</uicontrol> button. The selection will be replaced with a new
      structured text.</p>
