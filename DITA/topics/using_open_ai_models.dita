    <title>Using the Open AI Models</title>
    <body>
    <p><term>Open AI GPT3</term> is the largest commercial AI model available to integrators. It
      contains about 175 billions weights, and it was trained on a huge corpus of text. Similar to
      other encoder/decoder language models, the training was done by 'hiding' some words from the
      input and asking the model to guess the missing word. </p>
    <image href="../img/open_ai_gpt3.png" id="image_ebr_tkq_5sb"/>
    <p>The resulting language model was able to find semantic connections between words, in some way
      'understanding' the meaning of a window of text, while being capable of doing much more than
      it was trained to do initially (e.g. responding to questions). </p>
    <p>Advantages of the Open AI GPT-3 Language Model:</p>
    <ul id="ol_qdk_gkq_5sb">
      <li>Semantic awareness</li>
      <li>Extensible</li>
      <li>‘Creative’</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages:<ul id="ol_cms_hkq_5sb">
        <li>Slow due to network latency since content is sent to <tm tmtype="reg">Open AI</tm>
            servers.<note id="note_syv_xkq_5sb" type="important"> Check the license terms of the
            Open AI platform to make sure your company agrees with sending parts of the edited
            document to the Open AI.</note></li>
        <li>Not always factually correct since it uses probabilistic responses.<note
            id="note_zqd_kkq_5sb" type="important">Always check the generated content. It behaves
            more like a brain than a database.</note></li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>To use the GTP-3 language models:<ol id="ol_w2r_bwx_wwb">
        <li>Go in the <uicontrol>Oxygen Smart Autocomplete</uicontrol> preferences page and setup
          the following areas: <ul id="ul_up2_bwx_wwb">
            <li><uicontrol>API Key</uicontrol> - This field allows you to configure the Open AI API
              Key.</li>
            <li><uicontrol>Model</uicontrol> - This drop-down allows you to select the Open AI model
              you intend to use for providing completions. It can be one of the base models. The
              default selection is <codeph>gpt-3.5-turbo</codeph>.<note id="note_j4n_kvp_5sb">The
                base models are named according to the following conventions (they contain one of
                the following keywords): <codeph>gpt</codeph> (signals the most capable model),
                  <codeph>davinci</codeph>, <codeph>curie</codeph>, <codeph>babbage</codeph>, and
                  <codeph>ada</codeph>.</note></li>
          </ul></li>
      <li>Go in the <uicontrol>Smart Autocomplete</uicontrol> view.and choose <uicontrol>Open
            AI</uicontrol> for the <uicontrol>Engine</uicontrol>. The interface then displays the
          following areas: <ul id="ol_rxq_2vp_5sb">
            <li>The list of proposals.</li>
            <li>A panel with actions that can transform the selected text from the editor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ol></p>
