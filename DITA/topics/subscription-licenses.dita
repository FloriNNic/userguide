    <p id="p_acn_bgk_54b">A <b>Subscription</b> license that allows you to use the application for a
      specific period of time (either 6 months or 1 year). This type of license is user-based and is
      covered by a Support and Maintenance Pack, which means that during the subscription period you
      will get free upgrades to all major and minor releases and priority technical support.</p>
