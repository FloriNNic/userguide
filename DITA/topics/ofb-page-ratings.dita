    <p id="p_hxw_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Page Ratings Statistics</uicontrol> page is where you can
      see the top 100 pages that have received an <term>up vote</term> and the top 100 pages that
      have received a <term>down vote</term> for a site configuration. Users with a role of
        <i>Owner</i> or <i>Admin</i> have access to this statistics page. To reach this page, click
      the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ofb-PageRatings16.png" id="image_txz_51g_gjb"/>Page
        Ratings</uicontrol> link in the left menu bar in the interface for the site
      configuration.</p>

    <p id="p_jxw_dgk_54b">The page displays the pages with the most up votes and down votes for the
      current site configuration. It includes a filter at the top to choose which versions to have
      their page ratings statistics displayed. Below the version filter, there are two tabs, one for
      the negative option and one for the positive option. The first tab contains a table with the
      top 100 pages that received down votes and the second tab contains a table with the top 100
      pages that received up votes.</p>
