    <title>Using the Built-in Algorithm</title>
    <body>
        <p>The built-in algorithm analyzes the set of all XML, HTML, or Markdown files from your
      project and creates a local index. Once this is selected, you can initiate the indexing of
      project files by clicking the <uicontrol>Reindex Project</uicontrol> button. The same effect
      is obtained if you reindex the project files from the <uicontrol>Open/Find
        Resources</uicontrol> view. When you save one of the indexed files, this will be re-indexed
      incrementally.</p>
    <p>If you select the <uicontrol>Auto-insert best proposals</uicontrol> checkbox, the text is
      inserted automatically. Deselecting this option allows you to choose from a list of proposals
      that are displayed in the view.</p>
    <p><b>Advantages</b>:<ul id="ol_kqz_wjq_5sb">
        <li>It is fast and works on your local computer. </li>
        <li>It generates content that you already have in the project.</li>
        <li>You can use it as a kind of text template library. The quality of the completions
          increase with the size of your text content in the project.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p><b>Disadvantages</b>:</p>
    <ul id="ul_dgp_zjq_5sb">
      <li>The proposals are not creative.</li>
      <li>There is no semantic search.</li>
    </ul>
