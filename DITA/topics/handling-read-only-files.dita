    <p product="authorEclipse editorEclipse developerEclipse" id="p_pv5_bgk_54b">The default workbench behavior applies
      when editing read-only files in the <b>Text</b> mode. For all other modes no modification is
      allowed provided that the file remains read-only.</p>
    <p product="author developer editor json" id="p_qv5_bgk_54b">If a file marked as read-only is
      opened in <ph keyref="product"/> you can by default perform modifications to it. This behavior
      is controlled by the <xref
        href="preferences-editor.dita#preferences-editor/preferences_can_edit_read_only"
          ><uicontrol>Can edit read only files</uicontrol> option</xref>. When attempting to save
      such files you will be prompted to save them to another location.</p>
    <p id="p_rv5_bgk_54b">You can check out the read-only state of the file by looking in the <xref
        href="viewing-file-properties.dita"><uicontrol>Properties</uicontrol> view</xref>. If you
      modify the file properties from the operating system and the file becomes writable, you can
      modify it on the spot without having to reopen it.</p>
    <p product="author developer editor json" id="p_sv5_bgk_54b">The read-only state is marked with
      a lock decoration that appears in the editor tab and specified in the tooltip for a certain
      tab.</p>
