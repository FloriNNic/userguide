      <title>Validate each file before committing</title>
      <p> To enable validation of each file before committing, check the <uicontrol>Validate each
          file before commiting</uicontrol> option on the Git addon's preferences page, which can be
        accessed as follows: from <uicontrol>"Git" menu -> "Settings" -> "Preferences"</uicontrol>
        or <uicontrol>Git Staging -> <image href="../img/Ellipsis18.png"/> button ->
          "Preferences"</uicontrol>. There must be no unstaged files, as these may affect the
        validation process. If validation problems are detected, then the commit operation will be
        stopped, a dialog to show this will appear and the problems can be viewed in the "Git
        pre-commit validation" tab from the "Results" area. If the option <uicontrol>Reject commit
          when validation problems occur</uicontrol> is checked, then the dialog that informs about
        finding validation issues will have two buttons: <uicontrol>Commit anyway</uicontrol> and
          <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol>, otherwise only <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol>. The
          <uicontrol>Commit anyway</uicontrol> button allows the commit operation to be completed
        even if validation issues have been found.</p>
