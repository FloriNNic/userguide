    <title>Moving a License Server installation to a new machine</title>
    <body>
        <p>Sometimes a License Server deployment needs to be moved to a different virtual machine,
            for example if your organization is moving to a different cloud provider. </p>
        <p>To ensure you make this transition with minimal impact on Oxygen users in your
            organization, follow these steps:</p>
        <p>
            <ol id="ul_j21_5q5_t5b">
                <li>Open the web-based administration page of your existing License Server
                    installation</li>
                <li>Click the <uicontrol>View License</uicontrol> link</li>
                <li>Send a request to support@oxygenxml.com asking to deactivate your license. This
                    email should include the following information:<ol id="ol_um2_tr5_t5b">
                        <li>The license key you obtained at step 2.</li>
                        <li>The reason for which you want to move the License Server to a new
                            virtual machine.</li>
                    </ol><p>You will receive an email that contains the license key to be activated
                        on the new server.</p></li>
                <li>Install the License Server on the new virtual machine</li>
                <li>Configure the license key your received at step 4 on the new License Server
                    installation.</li>
                <li>Perform the required configuration to move all Oxygen users to the new
                        server.<ol id="ol_cdd_nr5_t5b">
                        <li>This is typically done by configuring the domain name of the License
                            Server to point to the new virtual machine.</li>
                    </ol></li>
                <li>Uninstall the old License Server.</li>
            </ol>
